There \nare evidences that the Ancient \nGreeks used to eat slices of \nflatbread topped with savouries, \nbut it was something far from \nthe pizza as we intend it now, also because tomatoes had only \nbeen imported to Europe many \ncenturies later, after Christopher A manual to discover the secrets  \nbehind world’s favourite food: Pizza. \nColombus discovered America \nin the XV century. \nModern pizza was probably \ninvented by a Neapolitan \nbaker, Raffaele Esposito, in \n1889 when in occasion of \nQueen Margherita and King \nUmberto I of Savoy visit to \nNaples, he created a pizza \nusing tomato sauce, mozzarella \nand basil leaves to represent \nthe colours of the Italian flag.

      "content": "4   »   IT ALICA TESSEN  »  PIZZA GUIDEFlour is the main \ningredient of pizza dough. \nThere are different types \nof flour, learning the \ndifferences between \nthem is fundamental \nin order to obtain the \nspecific desired result. \nFlour is obtained from \nthe milling of wheat. \nThere are two different \nkinds of wheat: 01 FLOUR FOR PIZZA\nCOMMON WHEAT\n(Triticum Aestivus), also known as \nbread or soft wheat\nCharacterised by very small round \nshaped granules and white in \ncolour . It is mainly used to make \nbread, pizza and bakery products in \ngeneral, fresh and egg pasta. \nDURUM WHEAT \n(Triticum Durum). \nThe flour obtained from durum wheat, \ninstead, is called “semola” and has \nlarger granules with a yellow-amber \ncolour , mainly used for the production \nof dry pasta. \nFLOUR FOR PIZZA\nThe flour used for pizza dough is the one obtained \nfrom common wheat (called simply wheat), for this \nreason in this guide we will always refer to common \nwheat when referring to flour .  1 2 IT ALICA TESSEN  »  PIZZA GUIDE   »   5Everything starts from the common \nwheat kernel , sometimes called \nwheatberry. It is the seed from which \nthe wheat plant grows and it is made of \nthree distinct parts: bran, endosperm and \ngerm. These three parts of the kernel are \nseparated during the milling process. \nWhEAT  \nFLOUR CAN bE \nCLASSIFIED IN:  \n00, 0, 1, 2 AND \nwHOLEWhEAT .THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOUR\n \nASH CONTENT \nIn Italy, the most common and recognised way to classify the \ndifferent types of flour is based on the ash or mineral content, which \ndepends on the amount of bran left if we were to burn 100g of flour . \nThe lower the ash content, the whiter the flour since it means it has \nbeen produced from the milling of the endosperm only. Wholewheat \nflour , instead, has the highest level of ash content because the bran \nand the germ are present as well. Wheat flour can be classified in: 00, \n0, 1, 2 and wholewheat.GERMENDOSPERMBRAN \nIncluded mainly in whole wheat flour , the bran (the outer part of the kernel) \nis another part of the kernel used to \nproduce white flour even if in smaller \nquantities compared to the endosperm. \nIt contains a small amount of protein \nand large quantities of minerals and of \nthe three major B-vitamins. ENDOSPERM \nThe endosperm is the source of white \nflour and contains the starch and the \ngreatest amount of protein, carbohy -\ndrates and iron. It is also the source for \nsoluble fibre. \nGERM\nThe inner part of the kernel, called germ, \nis normally separated from the flour \nmilling because of its high fat content \nwhich compromises the shelf life of the \nflour . \nThe germ, instead, is present in \nwholewheat flour and it is also possible \nto find it in artisanal stone-milled flour. BRAN\nThe percentage of brand and endosperm depends \non the refining level (milling and sifting) of the flour .",

We will \nprovide you with an \noverview of what are the \nsteps involved in every \nmethod, suggestions and \nrecommendations. \nPlease consider that \nthere are many factors \nthat can affect the \nprocess of making pizza \n(temperature, humidity, \nstrength of the flour \nand so on). For this \nreason, the information \nprovided below have to \nbe considered as general \nguidelines that may \nhave to be adapted to \nthe specific need and \nsituation.  \nThe main ingredients \nof pizza dough are flour, \nyeast, water and salt.  \nThe different methods \nused to prepare the \npizza dough affect the \nquantity and the order in \nwhich these ingredients \nare mixed together. DIRECT DOUGH\nDirect dough is the traditional and most common method to make the \ndough, which donates the classic flavor and aroma to the pizza. It is based on alcoholic fermentation, obtained thanks to Brewer’s Y east (Saccharomyces \nCerevisiae) and offers excellent results. Direct dough is made mixing all the \ningredients - flour, water, salt and yeast (fresh or dry) - together.\nThis is the most popular way of making pizza. It guarantees consistency to \nthe dough, high digestibility and it is easy and quick to make. Based on the \nstrength of the flour we use, we may opt for a direct method with short or \nlong fermentation. \nThe direct method with a short \nleavening time can be used with flour \nwith a W (strength) around 220. After \nmixing and kneading all the ingredients \ntogether , the dough is left to rest and \nproof for a first fermentation that can \nlast around 15-20 minutes. This step is \nfollowed by the shaping of the dough \nand by a second, longer proofing \nfor about 8 - 12 hours at room \ntemperature or until it doubles in size, \nbefore being ready to be used. \nLike the short one, the direct method with a long fermentation starts mixing all the ingredients together , but this time a stronger flour (with a W of \nat least 240) is needed. Another important factor to consider is that if we opt \nfor a long fermentation, the quantity of yeast has to be reduced compared \nto the short method. \nOnce kneaded, the dough is left resting at room temperature for around 20 \nminutes, covered with cling film. After this first short proofing, the dough has \nto be placed in the fridge at a temperature between +4° +6° C degrees for \na time that can vary between a minimum of 12 hours to a maximum of 96 \nhours depending on the strength of the flour and the final product that we \nwant to obtain.   03 WAYS OF MAKING PIZZA\nThe most common \nmethods of \nmaking pizza \ndough can be \nclassified in:\n- Direct Dough\n- Indirect Dough:  \n- Biga  \n- Poolish\n- Natural YeastDIRECT DOUGh IS \nMADE MIXING ALL THE \nINGREDIENTS - FLOUR, \nwATER, SALT AND yEAST \n(FRESh OR DR y)  \n- TOGETHER.",

The preparation takes place \nin two distinct phases. In the first \nphase, flour is mixed with water and \nyeast. The hydration is low, from 30% \nto 50% of the dough (biga, in fact, is \na dry pre-dough) and the quantity \nof dried yeast used is around 6g for each kg of flour . The temperature of \nthe pre-dough should be constantly \naround 20-22° C degrees. In the \nsecond step, after a proofing time of \n18 – 24 hours,  \nthe Biga is refreshed with flour , water \nand salt.

Note that the longer the mixing \nthe higher the Friction T will be, so always use the \nsame the same settings on the Mixer .",
